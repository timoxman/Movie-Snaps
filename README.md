Brief:
-----

Movie Snaps is a website app you can use to record visits you make to movie locations across the world. You can create new visits, adding a photo (with caption) of yourself re-enacting your chosen scene, which can then be liked and commented upon by other users.

Visitors can search the site and view the visits relating to specific locations, movies and users.


Original pitch:
-----

*Locations where films were shot often prove popular tourist destinations: the Ghostbusters Firehouse in New York; Amelie's Cafe des Deux Moulins in Paris; the Park Hyatt Tokyo where Bob and Charlotte connect whilst Lost In Translation; Hobbiton in New Zealand, to name but a few.*

*As a movie lover, imagine going on holiday and having an app that pinpoints where scenes from your favourite movies were shot, ranging from the biggest blockbusters to more arthouse indie fare.*

*My Movie Holiday uses a user-compiled database of locations that hooks up to a movie API and Google Maps to create an ever-growing worldwide map of places to add to your holiday itinerary.*

*So as to expand the site's community, dedicated users will be able to post photos/videos of themselves at locations re-enacting the iconic scenes once shot there.*
